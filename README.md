# Distributed Frank-Wolfe Framework for Trace Norm Minimization
This repository accompanies my working paper 

- A Distributed Frank-Wolfe Framework for Learning Low-Rank Matrices with the Trace Norm

as well as my PhD dissertation

- A Distributed Frank-Wolfe Framework for Trace Norm Minimization

## Difference between these two works
- My working paper focuses on matrices in *general space*. My dissertation studies *general matrices*, *symmetric matrices* and *positive semidefinite matrices*.

- My disseration includes only the slow convergence rate. My working paper quantifies also the fast convergence rate when hypotheses cound be made on the distribution of the singular values.

- My working paper describes only the dense representation. My disseration discusses also the low-rank representation.

- My working paper provides a coarse-grained analysis of the elapsed time. My dissertation provides a fine-grained one.
